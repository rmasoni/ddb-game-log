## ❓ How to set up the module

<!-- TODO -->


---


## ⚠️ Known issues

- D&D Beyond closes the websocket connection every 2 hours, so the module has to follow that and reconnect.


## 🧩 Compatibility

Severity | Service | Description
---------|---------|------------
Breaking | Beyond20 | Please disable both the Beyond20 Foundry module and the Beyond20 Chrome Extension or DDB Game Log won't be able to display your rolls.
Warning | The Forge | Users have noticed some problems when using the module in Forge instances. These issues are currently under investigation.
